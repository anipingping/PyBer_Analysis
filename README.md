# PyBer_Analysis 

## Purpose of the Analysis
This analysis seeks to find variances between urban, suburban and rural cities where PyBer drivers are active. 

## Results

### Table I: Total Rides, Drivers, Fares, Avg Fare per Ride, Avg Fare per Driver & Total Fare by City Type
The table below indicates that there are more rides were provided in urban city types than in suburban or rural cities. There were significantly more drivers available in urban city types, as well. The total fares for urban rides was approximately $40k, less than $20k in suburban cities and less than $5k in rural cities.
Interestingly, the average fare per ride was higher in rural and suburban areas. This difference is probably explained by the greater distances traveled in suburban and rural areas. The average fare per driver was also higher in rural and suburban cities than in urban cities. This is likely correlated with the average fare per ride in suburban and rural areas.

### Table II: Fare Summary
Table II displays the total fares collected per week between January 1 and April 29, 2019. The multiple line chart  demonstrates that urban city types consistently collect a greater stream of fare revenue than suburban or rural cities. There are slight peaks and troughs in the line chart but they do not appear to correspond clearly with seasonal changes in the weather. There appears to be a spike in fares collected in rural and suburban cities in late February but no other clear trends are available with the data organized by these 3 categories over this period of time.

## Summary - three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

  1. Get rid of "city type" - Instead of binning the cities into three somewhat simplistic categories, why not identify them by national region? Reorganizing city type by national region, time zone, city population, or other geographic features would likely provide more insight into patterns and trends.
  2. Look at a wider span of time - this analysis looked at a very small period between January 1 and April 29, 2019. This period seems somewhat arbitrary, misses the summer travel months and the holidays, and is probably not a long enough period of time to adequately assess any longitudinal variance between city types.
  3. Consider boosting driver counts in suburban and rural areas - there seems to be the potential for more fare collection in rural and suburban areas where the distances being traveld and, consequently, the fares collected, are much higher than in urban areas. Maybe this indicates pent-up demand in rural areas for PyBer services? I think the question of PyBer performance in rural and suburban areas probably needs to be assessed more thoroughly. Is this pattern uniform within the rural category? Are there clusters of rural cities that perform better than others? Greater depth and detail is needed for this analysis to provide the insight needed.
